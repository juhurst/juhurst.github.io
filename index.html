While it seems to move slowly, it it simply saving its true power and speed for the streams of the rivers in which it roams. They are nimble, easily repelling water and retaining heat for optimal temperature in all seasons.</p>

                <p>Arceus is rendered useless when Bidoof's battle cry is heard from below on the mortal plane. Giratina quakes when Bidoof emerges from the shadows. The world has yet to appreciate Bidoof's magical powers, its glory, its beauty. Bidoof is to the world what water is to humans: the most basic component of life. Early in one's journey it can be found: it is not here to hide, it's here to enlighten. It roams freely in the outskirts of legendary dens, keeping them protected and secure from impure seekers of the region's truths. When Bidoof reaches its final form as Bibarel, it is only then truly unstoppable. Bibarel guards the other mythical creatures where Bidoofs cannot thrive: they together ensure the safety of the deities the elders worship and protect. With its attack, defense, and even special stats, along with immense HP and speed (holding a Quick Claw), its almighty moves terrify even the deepest rooted of rivals. Bidoof is our Lord, Bibarel is our Savior, and both are the reasons we are alive today. Bidoof and Bibarel are the Gods others don't accept, but the Gods we need. Underestimated but never forgotten by those who have accepted their otherworldly spirits.</p>
